# Accounting-Game
A family friend approached me to create an interactive accounting game for their final PGCE presentation. This was created in one night.

Game was created using pyGame and Python 2.7. The app was delivered to the client as an x64 executable created using cx-Freeze.
These files are not included here, only the main .py file and required image and font files are included.
